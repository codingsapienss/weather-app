# weather-app
live-demo : https://weather31.netlify.app/

This is a simple weather app project created with the help of javascript, html and css. 
This project uses openweathermap API to fetch the weather data with the help of fetch api.
I have also used navigator api in this project so it asks for permission to get your location (longitude and latitude) for showing the weather forcast and weather info.

I hope you will love it.
